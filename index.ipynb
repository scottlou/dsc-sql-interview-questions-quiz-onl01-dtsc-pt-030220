    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The ones we learned we INTEGER, NULL, TEXT, BLOB. REAL is the other.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Primary key is used to UNIQUELY identify records in a rable, whereas forweign key establishes a relationship between tables. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "### ONE-TO-ONE: both tables can only have one recoed on either side of the relationship, each primkey val relates to one or no record in related table (married/spouse input-outputs)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ONE-TO-MANY: primary key table contains only one record that relates to none, one , or many records in related table (one mother, many children)\n",
    "\n",
    "### MANY-TO-MANY: each record in both trables can relate to any numbeer of records or none in the other table\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line: http://www.sql-join.com/sql-join-types\n",
    "\n",
    "### INNER JOIN: select all records from both tables where join condition is met\n",
    "### FULL JOIN: select all records whether condition is met or not\n",
    "### LEFT / RIGHT JOIN: select all records from primary table along with records from alternate table that fit condition\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "### GROUP BY arranges rows into groups and AGG function returns the summary (count, min, max, average, sum, etc.) for each group \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Type your answer below this line:\n",
    "\n",
    "### the associative entity is the table and USING/ON values that associates two other tables in a MANY-TO-MANY relationshp\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
